## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of linear algebra in data science, focusing on dimensionality reduction with PCA and cluster analysis using K-Means.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Custom implementation of K-Means clustering
- Data visualization for exploratory analysis

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Colab notebook: [Linear_Algebra_&_Clustering.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P2wFYIqfq8LiJn1f7LhL0J8I5GgvqQgD?usp=sharing)
2. Upload `bank.csv` data.
3. Run the cells to perform data analysis and visualization.

## Results
- The primary components for data variance and corresponding reductions are identified.
- Cluster analysis reveals distinct groupings, providing insights into potential customer segmentation.
